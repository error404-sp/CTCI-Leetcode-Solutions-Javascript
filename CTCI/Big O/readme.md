# Big O

   *  To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation
   *  Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm
   * Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (linear? quadratic? constant?)
* The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
    * Big O Notation is everywhere, so get lots of practice!
