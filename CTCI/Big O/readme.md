# Big O

## Time Complexity
   *  To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation
   *  Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algorithm
   * Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (linear? quadratic? constant?)
* The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware used to run the algorithm
    * Big O Notation is everywhere, so get lots of practice!
* `O(1) < O(logN)< O(N) < O(NlogN) < O(N^2)`
* When the input divides itself it is logN

## Space Complexity

* Most primitive (boolean,number,undefined,null) are constant space
* Strings require **O(n)** space;
* Reference types are generally **O(N)** space,where n is the length (for arrays) or number of keys(for objects)
