# Problem solving approach

## Understanding the problem
* Restate the question in your own words
* What are the inputs?
* What is the expected output?
* Do we have all information to get to the output using the inputs
* label data

## Concrete Examples
* Write simpler examples
* Think of complex examples
* Think/ask about edge cases
* Think/ask the empty input
* Think or ask about invalid input

## Break It Down
* Writing logic of the code by breaking down and speaking solution
## Solve or Simplify
* Solving the problem

## Look Back and Refactor
* Optimise and refactor unnecessary code ,make it readable and also making the algorithm more efficient.

* Can you check the result?
* Can you derive the result differently?
* Can you understand it at a glance?
* Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
* Can you improve the performance of your solution?
* Can you think of other ways to refactor?
* How have other people solved this problem
